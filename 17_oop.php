/*
  From PHP5 onwards you can write PHP in either a procedural or object oriented way. OOP consists of classes that can hold "properties" and "methods". Objects can be created from classes.

    // Access Modifiers: public, private, protected
    // public - can be accessed from anywhere
    // private - can only be accessed from inside the class
    // protected - can only be accessed from inside the class and by inheriting classes

//Instantiate a user object
